# Revive Arsh

Welcome to the **Revive Arsh** project! This repository is designed to help you kickstart your journey with [Revive Arsh].

## Setting up .env

To properly configure your environment, you'll need to create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project. This file will contain all the necessary environment variables that your application needs to run.

Here's a basic example of what your `.env` file might look like:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID="..."
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET="production"
```

Make sure to replace the placeholder values with your actual configuration.
